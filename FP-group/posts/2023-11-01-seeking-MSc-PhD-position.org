#+TITLE: How to come here to study for a MSc or PhD
#+AUTHOR: Patrik Jansson

This post collects some links useful in answers to emails about
"Seeking PhD position" or "Prospective MSc student".

The CSE department (shared between [[https://www.chalmers.se/en/][Chalmers]] and [[https://www.gu.se/en][UGOT]]) offers education
programmes at BSc, MSc, and PhD (doctoral) level. The admission to BSc
and MSc programmes is handled nationally for all Swedish universities
at http://www.universityadmissions.se/ and a good description of the
application procedure is available [[https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/application-and-admission/][on Chalmers central pages]]. The CSE
information is [[https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/education/][available here]].

The doctoral education is handled differently, and each PhD position
is announced openly as an (academic) employment opportunity here

  https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/work-with-us/vacancies/

Pick "Computer Science and Engineering" as the department and "PhD
Student Positions" as "profession".

If your interests match that of the Functional Programming Group, do
get in touch, but please note that the formal application for education
programmes or PhD positions is not handled "locally" by us.

Kind regards,
  Patrik Jansson
