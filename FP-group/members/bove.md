I am an Associate Professor (Docent) at the Computing Science division 
of the department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers 
university of technology and University of Gothenburg in Göteborg, Sweden.

Since 1995 I work in *Constructive Type Theory* and, in particular, 
Martin-Löf type theory.

Constructive type theory is a very expressive programming language with 
dependent types. In addition, logic can be represented in type theory by 
identifying propositions with types and proofs with terms of the 
corresponding types. Therefore, we can encode in a type a complete 
specification, requiring logical properties from an algorithm. As a 
consequence, algorithms are correct by construction or can be proved 
correct by using the expressive power of constructive type theory. In 
some of my papers I use type theory to prove properties of certain 
algorithms or systems.

A computational limitation of type theory is that, to keep the logic 
consistent and type-checking decidable, only structural recursive 
definitions are allowed, that is, definitions in which the recursive 
calls must have structurally smaller arguments. In many of my papers, 
including my Ph.D. thesis General Recursion in Type Theory 
<https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~bove/phd_thesis.pdf>, I present methods 
that allows us to write general recursive algorithms (that is, 
non-structurally smaller recursive algorithms) in type theory.
