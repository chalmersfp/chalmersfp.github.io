I work at the intersection of Programming Languages and Systems Research. I have worked and hacked on various programming language runtimes (GHC, JVM) and had the fortune of creating [one myself](https://github.com/SynchronVM/SynchronVM).
My current research predominantly centers on Trusted Computing and explores methods for enforcing trust, both in a formal context and through practical application in systems using programming language abstractions.
