My main interest is language technology, i.e., how to get computers to understand human language. At the moment I am mainly pursuing three paths – grammar formalisms, corpus querying and quantitative text analysis. My interest in grammar formalisms is very general and can be summarised in the following question: "How we can use grammars to specify and encode not just linguistic syntax, but also other information?". My interest in corpus querying concerns both how to design query languages that help linguists searching in annotated corpora, and how to optimise these searches for very large corpora. My interest in text analysis is how it can be used for understanding socio-linguistic phenomena.
