My main interest is language technology, i.e., how to get computers to understand human language. At the moment I am mainly pursuing two paths – grammar formalisms and quantitative text analysis. My interest in grammar formalisms is very general and can be summarised in the following question: "How we can use grammars to specify and encode not just linguistic syntax, but also other information?". My interest in text analysis is how it can be used for understanding socio-linguistic phenomena.
