I am a PhD student working with Carl Seger and Mary Sheeran.
My background is computer engineering with a focus on computer architecture and parallel programming.
In theory, my work involves side-channel attacks with a focus on power estimation.
In practice I spend most of my time writing C that segfaults, python with indentation errors, and systemverilog with features that the compiler does not support yet.
Talk to me about cache hierarchies, low-power design, and parallel programming. If you have some verilog to synthesize I can do that as well.
